# ðŸ›° ISS

A console-based program that:

1. Takes an input of an address and resolves it using the OpenStreetMap API.  
2. If resolved, returns a lat/lon for the location
3. Uses lat/lon to request future pass times of the ISS using the OpenNotify API.  
4. Calculates the time left until the ISS will pass over your location.
